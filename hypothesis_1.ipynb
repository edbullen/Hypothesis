    "Classical hypothesis testing is concerned with deciding between two decisions (it is more complicated if there’s more than two). \n",
    "+ The first, a Null Hypothesis is specified that represents the status quo. This hypothesis is usually labeled, $H_{0}$. This is what we assume by default.  In a practical sense, this would mean that there is no significant difference between the data-set being assessed and the general population.\n",
    "+ The Alternative or research hypothesis is what we require evidence to conclude.  This hypothesis is usually labeled $H_{a}$ or sometimes $H_{1}$ (or some other number other than 0). \n",

    "There is a great video from Khan Academy they introduces Hyptothesis Testing here:  \n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS6KEWaoOOE  \n",
    "\n",
    "The convention for Hypothesis testing is to define a value \"**alpha**\" or $\\alpha$ which is the *probability threshold* for which we accept ot reject the Null Hypothesis.  This is also known as the \"Significance Level\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "By convention a value of 0.05 (5%) is chosen for $\\alpha$, although sometimes this can be set to $\\alpha$ = 0.01 if we want more certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to calculate the **p-value**, which is the estimated probability of getting this sample by chance (from the population we are comparing against).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If the p-value is *less* than $\\alpha$ then we *reject* the Null Hypothesis, $H_{0}$ and assume that is unlikely that the variance in the mean of our sample occured by chance.  There is a statistically significant difference.\n",
    "+ If the p-value is *greater* than $\\alpha$ then we \"accept\" the Null Hypothesis (or at least, we cannot reject it) and assume there is a reasonable chance the variation in our test result could have occured by chance.\n",
